    <p>BMW is a car made for driving on real roads. It is known for good balance, strong engines, and smooth control. Many people like BMW because it feels stable and confident, especially on the highway.

On a highway, also called a motorway, cars are allowed to drive faster than in the city. In many countries, the speed limit on a highway is about 120–130 kilometers per hour. A BMW can easily drive at this speed without problems.
