    <p>BMW is a car made for driving on real roads. It is known for good balance, strong engines, and smooth control. Many people like BMW because it feels stable and confident, especially on the highway.

On a highway, also called a motorway, cars are allowed to drive faster than in the city. In many countries, the speed limit on a highway is about 120–130 kilometers per hour. A BMW can easily drive at this speed without problems.

<p>The S-Class has always been more than metal and machinery — it’s a legacy of comfort, power, and cutting-edge technology that dates back generations. Today’s iteration of this flagship sedan blends classical prestige with state-of-the-art modern features that redefine what a luxury car can be.
Under the long hood sat a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine, tuned with mild-hybrid technology that gave it both grunt and grace — roughly 442 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque — paired with a silky-smooth 9-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. The result was effortless acceleration and poise, whether you were gliding through city streets or swallowing highway miles.</p>
